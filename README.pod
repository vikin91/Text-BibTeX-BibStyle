Text-BibTeX-BibStyle

Text::BibTeX::BibStyle is a module that can format
Text::BibTeX::Entry objects by interpreting a bibstyle (.bst) file
such as ieeetr.bst.  In this way, Perl can use the same
bibliographic style files that bibtex does.

For a large collection of .bst files, see
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bibtex/index.html.
